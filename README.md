- *Why I Choose this imaging technique?*
  - Using this technique can significantly boost the visual depth and make the art more alive and interactive. Trapunto creating cool effects with light and shadow that highlight painting’s bright colors and detailed patterns. It’s a great way to pull viewers in and give them a more intense, hands-on experience with the art. I want to incorporate this three-dimensional technique into my project, which can make the geometric shapes in my project more tangible and visually appealing.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

> In this part, I want to use the **Geometries** encoding technology to run in p5.js.

- *Why I Choose this coding technique?*
- This coding technique can help me to create a 3D canvas and draw various geometric shapes, including planes, cubes, cylinders, cones, toruses, and spheres. Each shape is dynamically rotated to create movement on the canvas, and lighting effects are applied to enhance the three-dimensional appearance.
