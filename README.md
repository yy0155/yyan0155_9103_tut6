## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### imaging technique: trapunto, a three-dimensional embroidery technique from Sicily, Italy, around the 14th century.

>**Trapunto** is an art form that utilizes embroidery techniques to create raised effects on fabric, resulting in a visually rich three-dimensional appearance.

- *Why I Choose this imaging technique?*
  - Using this technique can significantly boost the visual depth and make the art more alive and interactive. Trapunto creating cool effects with light and shadow that highlight painting’s bright colors and detailed patterns. It’s a great way to pull viewers in and give them a more intense, hands-on experience with the art. I want to incorporate this three-dimensional technique into my project, which can make the geometric shapes in my project more tangible and visually appealing.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

> In this part, I want to use the **Geometries** encoding technology to run in p5.js.

- *Why I Choose this coding technique?*
- This coding technique facilitates the creation of a 3D canvas and the rendering of diverse geometric shapes, including planes, cubes, cylinders, cones, toruses, and spheres. Each shape undergoes dynamic rotation, imbuing the canvas with fluid movement, while lighting effects are applied to heighten the three-dimensional appearance. Employing this technology can imbue the geometric figures within my project with a palpable three-dimensional visual effect, enhancing the overall texture of the project.
